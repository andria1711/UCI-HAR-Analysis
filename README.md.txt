# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

## Description
This project analyzes data collected from the accelerometers of a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The goal is to perform data cleaning and create a tidy dataset containing average measurements for each activity and subject.

## Instructions
1. Download the Samsung dataset from [UCI HAR Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).
2. Place the data files in your working directory.
3. Run the `run_analysis.R` script in R.
4. The output will be `tidy_data.txt`.

## Output
The tidy dataset contains average measurements for each activity and subject.
